## Major improvements

Highlights of this version

* Embedded HAProxy upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4.
* Partial Gateway API v1alpha2 support, see the [Gateway API getting started page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/gateway-api/).
* Option to customize the response payload for any of the status codes managed by HAProxy or HAProxy Ingress, see the [HTTP Responses](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response) configuration key documentation.
* Option to run the embedded HAProxy as Master Worker. Running HAProxy as Master Worker enables [worker-max-reloads](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#master-worker) option without the need to configure as an external deployment, enables HAProxy logging to stdout, and also has a better management of the running process. This option is not enabled by default, see the [master worker documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#master-worker) for further information.
* HAProxy Ingress can now be easily launched in the development environment with the help of the `--local-filesystem-prefix` command-line option. See also the command-line option [documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#local-filesystem-prefix) and the new `make` variables and targets in the [README](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/#develop-haproxy-ingress) file.

## Upgrade notes

Breaking backward compatibility from v0.13:

* Default `auth-tls-strict` configuration key value changed from `false` to `true`. This update will change the behavior of misconfigured client auth configurations: when `false` misconfigured mTLS send requests to the backend without any authentication, when `true` misconfigured mTLS will always fail the request. See also the [auth TLS documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#auth-tls).
* Default `--watch-gateway` command-line option changed from `false` to `true`. On v0.13 this option can only be enabled if the Gateway API CRDs are installed, otherwise the controller would refuse to start. Since v0.14 the controller will always check if the CRDs are installed. This will change the behavior on clusters that has Gateway API resources and doesn't declare the command-line option: v0.13 would ignore the resources and v0.14 would find and apply them. See also the [watch gateway documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/command-line/#watch-gateway).
* All the response payload managed by the controller using Lua script was rewritten in a backward compatible behavior, however deployments that overrides the `services.lua` script might break. See the [HTTP Responses](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response) documentation on how to customize HTTP responses using controller's configuration keys.
* Two frontends changed their names, which can break deployments that uses the frontend name on metrics, logging, or in the `config-proxy` global configuration key. Frontends changed are: `_front_https`, changed its name to `_front_https__local` if at least one ssl-passthrough is configured, and `_front__auth`, changed its default value to `_front__auth__local`. These changes were made to make the metric's dashboard consistent despite the ssl-passthrough configuration. See the new [metrics example page](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/examples/metrics/) and update your dashboard if using HAProxy Ingress' one.

# v0.14.0-alpha.2

## Reference (a2)

* Release date: `2022-04-07`
* Helm chart: `--version 0.14.0-alpha.2 --devel`
* Image (Quay): `quay.io/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.0-alpha.2`
* Image (Docker Hub): `jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress:v0.14.0-alpha.2`
* Embedded HAProxy version: `2.4.15`
* GitHub release: `https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases/tag/v0.14.0-alpha.2`

## Release notes (a2)

This is the second and last alpha release of v0.14, which fixes the following issues:

- The configured service was not being selected if the incoming path doesn't finish with a slash, the host is not declared in the ingress resource (using default host), the path type is Prefix, and the pattern is a single slash.
- Marvin Rösch fixed a delay of 5 seconds to connect to a server using a TCP service. Such delay happens whenever a host is used in the ingress resource and the SSL offload is made by HAProxy.

Other visible improvements include:

- Add compatibility with HAProxy 2.5 deployed as external/sidecar. Version 2.5 changed the lay out of the `show proc` command of the master API.
- Add the ability to overwrite any of the HAProxy generated response payloads, see the [HTTP Response documentation](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/v0.14/docs/configuration/keys/#http-response)
- Add `ssl-fingerprint-sha2-bits` configuration key which adds a HTTP header with the SHA-2 fingerprint of client certificates.
- Update to the latest version of golang 1.17, client-go v0.23 and haproxy 2.4

There is also a few other internal and non visible improvements. First beta version should be tagged within a week or so, after finish some exploratory tests.
